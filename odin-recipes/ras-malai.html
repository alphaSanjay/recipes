        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            Ras Malai is cheese dumplings in cream sauce. This is a popular 
            Indian dessert and takes a long time to prepare the traditional way.
            I came up with some shortcuts and ended up with this recipe which 
            tastes exactly the same as traditional Ras Malai.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (15 ounce) container whole-milk ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>3 cups half and half</li>
            <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground cardamom</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon rose water (Optional)</li>
            <li>1 pinch saffron</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chopped blanched almonds</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons chopped pistachio nuts</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>step 1:
                <p>
                    Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>step 2:
                <p>
                    Blend the ricotta cheese and 1/4 cup sugar together in a bowl with 
                    a hand mixer; divide the mixture between 12 muffin cups.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>step 3:
                <p>
                    Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out 
                    clean, 35 to 40 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool 
                    completely on a wire rack. Arrange the cheese balls onto a dessert platter.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>step 4:
                <p>
                    While the cheese bakes, pour the half and half into a saucepan and bring to 
                    a simmer over low heat; simmer 10 minutes. Stir 1 cup sugar, the cardamom, rose 
                    water, and saffron into the half and half and simmer another 2 minutes. Remove 
                    from heat and allow to cool completely. Drizzle the cooled mixture over the cheese
                    balls. Sprinkle the almonds and pistachios over the cheese balls to serve.
